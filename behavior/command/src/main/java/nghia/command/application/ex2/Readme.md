<h2>Command</h2>
 
  The Command pattern encapsulates a request to do something as an object.
  <p>
  The pattern does a great job of decoupling the object that is making the request (Command Invoker) from the object
  that receives the request (Receiver) and performs the action; it does this by using a middleman: the Command object.
  <p>
  The Command interface does the decoupling. The Command Invoker knows nothing about the Receivers; it just calls
  the execute() method on the Command. The Client decides which Receiver the Command performs operations on when it
  builds the Command object. This Command object is then set on the Command Invoker - the Client
  <em>parameterises</em> it.
  <p>
  The main benefit of the pattern is that new Commands and Receivers can be slotted in without changing the
  Command Invoker and existing Command/Receivers already setup; you just create new Command objects and set them
  on the Command Invoker.
 
  <h2>Actors</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Command interface - all Concrete Commands must implement this; this is the interface for executing an operation.</li>
  <li>Concrete Command - the Command implementation. Performs the operation on a Receiver.</li>
  <li>Receiver - the target for the Command. It knows how to make things happen/perform the operations.
                 Command objects wrap a Receiver and invoke actions on it. </li>
  <li>Command Invoker - Clients use this to invoke Commands and make them happen. Clients parameterise the invoker,
                        i.e. set the Commands they want to invoke on the Invoker.</li>
  <li>Client - Creates the Receivers, Commands, parameterises the Command Invoker, and then uses the Command Invoker
               to select and execute Commands.</li>
  </ul>
 
  <h2>Usages</h2>
  Very common in UI toolkits, e.g. when a button is clicked an actionPerformed() method is often called. Also used
  in server-side frameworks for processing messages/commands from queues; example code picks orders off an exchange
  queue.
